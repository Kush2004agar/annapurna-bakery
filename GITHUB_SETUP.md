# Upload to GitHub - Step by Step

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top right → **"New repository"**
3. Repository name: `annapurna-bakery` (or any name you prefer)
4. Description: "Beautiful bakery website for Annapurna Bakery by Seema Maheshwari"
5. Choose **Public** or **Private**
6. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have files)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

After creating, GitHub will show you a page with commands. Copy the repository URL.
It will look like: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/annapurna-bakery.git`

## Step 3: Run These Commands

After you create the repository, come back here and I'll help you push the code!

Or run these commands (replace YOUR-USERNAME and REPO-NAME):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
